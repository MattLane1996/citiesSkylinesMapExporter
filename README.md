# citiesSkylinesMapExporter
Python scripts for making videos of city growth using the cslmapview mod for Cities Skylines.
Place mapExport.py in the folder with your \*.cslmap.gz.  
Place videoMaker.py in the image dump folder that you created.  
There are user parameters at the top of both files that allow you to set the name of your city, the image dump folder, and set the resolution of the video, meaning you need basically zero knowledge of Python. However, you will still be required to install Numpy and Opencv with Pip to make this work.
